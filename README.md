# Assignment 4: Collager

For this assignment, we were asked to create a collager, which would allow a user to interact with an application similar to Gimp or Photoshop. The user is able to create a new project, add layers to this project, save the project, quit, and then reopen it at a later time if desired. In addition, when an image is added, the user is able to add a filter onto the image. The filters include: red-component, green-component, blue-component, brighten-value, brighten-intensity, brighten-luma, darken-value, darken-intensity, and darken-luma. 

# Design
In order to create a proper design for this assignment, we considered various components that may be added in the future, and that would be important to abstract to avoid issues with our program in the future.
